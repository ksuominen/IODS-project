# About the project

I have learned about the course Introduction to Open Data Science through my PhD studies. I'm exited to start the course but also a bit worried about the workload. The course Moodle page seems to contain **a lot** of information, so probably will take a while to get a handle on things. 

I have previously used R and Rstudio on some courses, but I'm no expert. I think that exercise 1 was too long, and all in all there was too much stuff to be learned about R in the first week. To me, this one really long exercise feels exhausting. It is nice that there are the R codes already embedded, but I feel smaller chunks would be better. If I hadn't done R before, I would be terrified right now.
